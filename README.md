## Project Overview

### Livebooks: Workverse – Code, Create, Conquer

This repository contains materials and instructions for **Project Sprint #1 – Coding with AI**.

---

## 1. Project Scope

**Main Goal:** Our team is building a Mini Game Arcade using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective is to deliver a collection of simple, browser-based games that are both fun and user-friendly, all accessible through a central landing page.

**Key Features / Deliverables:**

- A clean, responsive landing page with links to all games.
- At least two fully functional games like Rock Paper Scissors and Tic Tac Toe.
- Each game will have a consistent UI/UX, with smooth navigation.
- A scoreboard or result display integrated into each game.
- Fully responsive design compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.

**Out of Scope (Currently):**

- Persistent data storage (e.g., saving scores after the session ends).
- User accounts or login systems.
- Multiplayer or online real-time gameplay features.

## 2. Milestones and Timeline

- **Sprint Kickoff:**
  - Finalize game ideas and divide roles based on skills.
  - Set up a shared GitHub repository with folders for each component (landing page, games, shared styles, etc.).
- **By “Game Structure with Copilot” Session:**
  - Use GitHub Copilot to help build logic for one game (e.g., Rock Paper Scissors).
  - Begin implementing the basic layout for the landing page.
  - Decide on a shared design language (colors, fonts, layout structure).
- **By “Mid-Sprint Demo + Feedback” Session:**
  - Have two games functional, with interactive elements and basic CSS.
  - Complete navigation between the landing page and games.
  - Run internal testing, gather feedback, and make initial bug fixes.
- **By Sprint End:**
  - Deploy final version using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
  - Ensure games are fully tested, styled, and responsive.
  - Optionally add a third game (e.g., Whack-a-Mole) if time allows.
  - Prepare short documentation and walkthrough for presentation.

## 3. Team Roles and Responsibilities

- **My Role:**
  - Design and develop the landing page, acting as the hub for the entire arcade.
  - Ensure all games are integrated smoothly and that navigation works as expected.
  - Contribute to styling consistency across all pages and manage transitions.
- **Other Team Members:**
  - **Varsha:** Build the Rock Paper Scissors game; lead UI styling shared across games.
  - **Jessica:** Develop Tic Tac Toe; ensure mobile responsiveness for all components.
  - **Tejas:** Build Whack-a-Mole; assist with logic debugging and shared JavaScript functions.
- **Collaboration and Communication:**
  - Fixed roles, but with flexibility to help others when needed.
  - Short daily sync-ups (standups) to track progress and resolve blockers.
  - Use GitHub PRs, branching, and a WhatsApp group for smooth collaboration and quick feedback.

## 4. Anticipated Challenges and Strategies

**Expected Challenges:**

- Merging different coding styles into a cohesive, consistent experience.
- Managing time effectively within the sprint.
- Testing and debugging games across various screen sizes and devices.

**Planned Strategies to Manage Them:**

- Follow a shared code style and naming convention from the beginning.
- Use modular components for reusable code (like buttons, modals, etc.).
- Conduct frequent testing after each commit to avoid bugs piling up.
- Provide peer support during blockers, especially in game logic or styling.
- Maintain a clean GitHub workflow using branches and PR reviews to avoid merge conflicts.
